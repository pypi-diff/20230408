 *ntLog* is a simple command line utility used to append discretely generated log 
 files into a running log formulated as a `NestedText <nestedtext.org>`_ file.  
 You can specify limits on how many log entries there are or how old they should 
 be.  Any entries that do not satisfy the limits are purged.

+Log entries older than ``--keep-for`` days are deleted.  If units are not 
+specified, ``--keep-for`` is given in days.  However you can directly specify 
+the units in terms of seconds (s, sec, second, seconds), minutes (m, min, 
+minute, minutes), hours (h, hr, hour, hours), days (d, day, days), weeks (w, W, 
+week, weeks), months (M, month, months), and years (y, Y, year, years).

+If the number of entries exceeds ``--max-entries``, the oldest entries are 
+deleted even if they are younger than the ``--keep-for`` limit.

 If ``--delete`` is specified, the given log file is deleted after its contents 
 are incorporated into the running log file.
 
 The key used when filing log entries into the *NestedText* document is the 
-timestamp for the modification time of the file.  The given logfile is always 
-kept, even if it is older than the specified limit.
+timestamp of the modification time of the given log file.
+
+The given log file is always kept, even if it is older than the ``--keep-for`` 
+limit.
 
 Log entries are sorted from most recent to oldest, with the most recent at the 
 top of the *NestedText* file.  The one exception to this rule is that the given 
 log file is always listed first, even if its modification time is older than 
 existing log entries.
